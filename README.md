Media query for Jetpack Compose to support all screen sizes

I implemented our own Media Query to compare screen heights and width and do proper actions according to situtation. It can help design more flexible UI in different screen sizes. In this case, I created basic app to show it. If screen width is greater than 400 dp "Raheem" text background color be red and if not is green, you can see the difference when rotating device as screen width changes. Also if screen height is less than 400 dp another text gets added.
